- __main__

Normally it's purpose is in the name: it's the name of the module. 
But when you run a Python program, the module you run always will have the name __main__ . 
This is useful when you have some code that you want to run only if you run that module directly.

What is the “top-level code environment”?
__main__ is the name of the environment where top-level code is run. 
“Top-level code” is the first user-specified Python module that starts running. 
It’s “top-level” because it imports all other modules that the program needs. 
Sometimes “top-level code” is called an entry point to the application.
